## Key Issues



## Data Sources

- City of Philadelphia
 - Philadelphia Properties and Current Assessments
- OpenDataPhilly
  - Philadelphia Neighborhoods Polygon
  - School attendance, withdrawls, location
- Geofrabrik
  - Economic activity locations
- US Census:
  - 5-year ACS data
    - Education, vacancy, family share, percent white, median income

## Model Comparison



## Hardest Neighborhoods to Predict

Affleunt neigborhoods

- Do we have a map for this?


## Recommendations




## Limitations & Next Steps

-  The inability to quantify word of mouth
  - Percieved neighborhood vibe shift can radically alter  future housing prices
    - I.e. Fishtown
- The non-incorporation of Philadelphia's future plans
 - Planned and ongoing infrastructure development greatly impacts where housing is developed
