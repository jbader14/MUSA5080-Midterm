## Project Intention

### **Why it Matters**
Philadelphia’s current Automated Valuation Model (AVM) is underperforming, leading to inconsistent and inequitable property assessments.

### **Our Guiding Question**

What key predictors are missing from the legacy model, and how can we improve its accuracy and fairness?

---

## Data Sources

- **City of Philadelphia**
  - Philadelphia Properties and Current Assessments (n= 21,807 Home Sales)

- **OpenDataPhilly**
  - Neighborhood Boundaries (Polygon)
  - School Locations, Attendance, and Withdrawals

- **Geofabrik (OpenStreetMap)**
  - Commercial and Economic Activity Points

- **U.S. Census (ACS 5-Year)**
  - Education
  - Vacancy Rates
  - Family Household Share
  - Percent White
  - Median Household Income

### **Key Findings**
- Prices cluster spatially  
- Center City & Northwest Philadelphia show highest home values  
- Additional hotspots in South Philadelphia

## Progressive Regression Models

**Goal:** Test whether place-based factors improve predictive accuracy.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log(\text{Price}) = \beta_0 &+ \color{red}{\beta_1 \log(\text{Livable Area}) + \beta_2 \text{Bedrooms} + \beta_3 \text{Bathrooms}} \\
&+ \color{red}{\beta_4 \text{Age} + \beta_5 \text{Interior Condition} + \beta_6 \text{Quality Grade}} \\
&+ \color{orange}{\beta_7 \text{Median Income} + \beta_8 \text{Family Household Ratio}}  \\
&+ \color{orange}{\beta_9 \text{% Bachelors}+ \beta_{10} \text{% Vacant} + \beta_{11} \text{% White}} \\
&+ \color{blue}{\beta_{12} \text{EconKDE} + \beta_{13} \text{EconKDE}^2 + \beta_{14} \text{TreeKDE} + \beta_{15} \text{Mean 3NN Dist}} \\
&+ \color{green}{\beta_{16} \text{MHI Quantile} + \beta_{17} (\text{MHI Quantile} \times \text{Age})} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

## Model Performance Improves at Each Stage

| Model | Adj. R² | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| (1) Structural | 0.38 | House features alone are not enough |
| (2) + Census | 0.60 | Neighborhood socioeconomic patterns matter |
| (3) + Spatial | 0.61 | Location and amenities add signal |
| (4) + Interactions | 0.64 | Wealthy areas shape how homes retain value |

**Takeaway:** Spatial + neighborhood effects are essential to explaining price variation in Philadelphia.

## Hardest Neighborhoods to Predict

### **Key Insight**
- The model struggles most in **high-value and low-value neighborhoods**; in other words, the extremes of the home sale price distribution.
- **Over-predicted (red):** Center City, Northwest Philly, Fishtown, South Philly  
  → Homes sell for **less than the model expects**
- **Under-predicted (blue):** Economically underserved neighborhoods  
  → Homes sell for **more than predicted**
- **Why?** Prestige, walkability, and growing interest are **not fully captured** by structural or census variables

## Key Findings

**Model Accuracy:** RMSE = 0.487 (log scale) 
- On average, the percent difference is 48.7% between expected and true logged housing prices. 


**Model Fit:** R² = 0.635 (0.682 with K-fold CV) 
- 63.5% of the variance in log(sales price) is explained by our model.

**Top Predictors**

- **Economic Density (U-shaped effect):** Strongest spatial driver of price
- **Home Size (β = 0.509, p < 0.001):** 1% increase in area → ~0.5% ↑ in price
- **Bathrooms (β = 0.151, p < 0.001):** Large value premium per added bath
- **Neighborhood Composition:** Higher education (+) and vacancy (–) strongly shape prices

**Key Insight:**  
Neighborhood effects matter as much as home features — *location premiums are real, measurable, and spatially clustered.*

## Recommendations

**Improve the City’s AVM by Incorporating:**

- **Amenity-based spatial features** (EconKDE, trees, school access)
- **Neighborhood context variables** to capture local market conditions

**Policy Implications**

- Current AVM likely **undervalues booming neighborhoods** near economic hubs
- **Affluent areas remain hardest to predict** due to prestige and perception effects
- Add monitoring for **rapidly changing neighborhoods (e.g., Fishtown)**

**Bottom Line:**  
To reduce inequity and improve accuracy, the AVM must move beyond structure-only predictors and account for **context, amenities, and spatial clustering.**


---

## Limitations & Next Steps

**Key Limitations**

- The model cannot quantify *word-of-mouth effects*  
  → Perceived “vibe shifts” can rapidly change prices
- Future plans are not incorporated  
  → Planned infrastructure can greatly alter market outcomes

**Where Do We Go From Here?**

- Build an enhanced model that includes:  
  → Amenity proximity  
  → Economic development indicators  
  → Spatial clustering of sale prices
  
- Continue data collection to track a changing housing landscape
- Consult with local government on new projects and emerging trends
