## Key Issues

- The City of Philadelphia's current automated valuation model (AVM) is underpreforming
- 

So what factors strongly influence housing price that the city could be overlooking?


---

## Data Sources

- City of Philadelphia
 - Philadelphia Properties and Current Assessments
- OpenDataPhilly
  - Philadelphia Neighborhoods Polygon
  - School attendance, withdrawls, location
- Geofrabrik
  - Economic activity locations
- US Census:
  - 5-year ACS data
    - Education, vacancy, family share, percent white, median income

---

## A mapped observations
 - Median houseing prices are clustered in specific areas of the City
 - Center City, Northwest Philadelphia, and select areas of South Philadelphia see the highest home prices

Neighborhood affluence concentrated in areas around Center City, Northwest Philadelphia, and South Philadelphia

## Recommendations


**Think about spatial variables**

Variables such as economic density and neighborhood play a large role

**Remain Nuanced**

The influence of a factor will likely vary by neighborhood

**Bathrooms > Bedrooms**

Imagine a 4 bed 4 BR unit vs a 4 bed 1 BR unit, the different in desirability is exponential

## Limitations & Next Steps

-  The inability to quantify word of mouth
  - Percieved neighborhood vibe shift can radically alter  future housing prices
    - I.e. Fishtown
- The non-incorporation of Philadelphia's future plans
 - Planned and ongoing infrastructure development greatly impacts where housing is developed
