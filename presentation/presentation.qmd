## Project Intention

### **Why it Matters**
Philadelphia’s current Automated Valuation Model (AVM) is underperforming, leading to inconsistent and inequitable property assessments.

### **Our Guiding Question**

What key predictors are missing from the legacy model, and how can we improve its accuracy and fairness?

## Data Sources

- **City of Philadelphia**
  - Philadelphia Properties and Current Assessments

- **OpenDataPhilly**
  - Neighborhood Boundaries (Polygon)
  - School Locations, Attendance, and Withdrawals

- **Geofabrik (OpenStreetMap)**
  - Commercial and Economic Activity Points

- **U.S. Census (ACS 5-Year)**
  - Education
  - Vacancy Rates
  - Family Household Share
  - Percent White
  - Median Household Income

::: column
### **Key Findings**
- Prices cluster spatially
- Center City & NW Philly are highest
- South Philly shows additional hotspots
:::

## Price Drivers

- Economic Density
- Livable Space
- Bedrooms v Bathrooms
- Building Age

## Stepwise Modeling Strategy

1. **Model 1:** Structural features only  
2. **Model 2:** + Census tract demographics  
3. **Model 3:** + Spatial features (KDE, proximity)  
4. **Model 4:** + Interactions and neighborhood effects

**Goal:** Test whether place-based factors improve predictive accuracy.

## Model Performance Improves at Each Stage

| Model | Adj. R² | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| (1) Structural | 0.38 | House features alone are not enough |
| (2) + Census | 0.60 | Neighborhood socioeconomic patterns matter |
| (3) + Spatial | 0.61 | Location and amenities add signal |
| (4) + Interactions | 0.64 | Wealthy areas shape how homes retain value |

**Takeaway:** Spatial + neighborhood effects are essential to explaining price variation in Philadelphia.

## Hardest Neighborhoods to Predict

### **Key Insight**
- Affluent neighborhoods are the **least predictable**
- Highest incomes cluster in:
  - Center City
  - Northwest Philadelphia
  - Parts of South Philadelphia
- Prices influenced by **amenities, prestige, and perception**, which are hard to quantify

## Recommendations


**Think about spatial variables**

Variables such as economic density and neighborhood play a large role

**Remain Nuanced**

The influence of a factor will likely vary by neighborhood

**Bathrooms > Bedrooms**

Imagine a 4 bed 4 BR unit vs a 4 bed 1 BR unit, the different in desirability is exponential

## Limitations & Next Steps

-  The inability to quantify word of mouth
  - Percieved neighborhood vibe shift can radically alter  future housing prices
    - I.e. Fishtown
- The non-incorporation of Philadelphia's future plans
 - Planned and ongoing infrastructure development greatly impacts where housing is developed
